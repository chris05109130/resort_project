King Resort(CSS Project)

This Project is a fake resort front page that I made. I made this project because I wanted to learn CSS Flex and this project will show that I do know how 
use CSS Flex the correct Way. So a little run down of the project is, its basically a resort that if you would go to the main page it will display images of the resort, prices, food and rooms.

SOme of the flex properties that I used in this project was

1. Display:flex;
2. justify-content
3. align-items
4. flex-wrap
5. flex-direction
